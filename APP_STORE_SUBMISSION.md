## Notes for App Review
The previous Local/LAN mode has been replaced by a streamlined Online Matchmaking system using a relay server.

**To test Multiplayer:**
1. Open two instances of the app (e.g., using Terminal: `open -n -a Zaychess`).
2. Click **"Multiplayer"** in both instances.
3. The app will automatically connect to the relay server and pair the two instances into a game. No manual IP entry or hosting configuration is required.
